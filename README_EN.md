# Qualcomm MSM8916 (Snapdragon 410) Portable Wi-Fi — Online Cloud Build OpenWrt

Tired of finding a decent firmware? Software repos won't install, the version is too old, or someone else's build is bloated with plugins you don't need. Just compile your own OpenWrt flash package — a few simple steps, no local environment needed, no Linux knowledge required, no compilation know-how. Build it, one-click flash it, done.

- Auto-pulls the latest ImmortalWrt source on every build
- Pick exactly the plugins you want; the firmware is entirely up to you
- Base image is heavily optimized — no need to worry about random bugs
- Supports custom packages: plugins, drivers, themes, Python, Perl, libs, and more

## Build Steps

1. First, fork this repository to your own account
   ![Fork repo](img/0.png)

2. Your repo → **Actions** → **Build_imm_Snapdragon_410_series** → **Run workflow** → Select your device model → Enter required plugin packages → Run workflow to start building
   ![Build tutorial](img/1.png)

3. Build takes approx. ⏱️ 1.5–2 hours; more plugins = longer build time
   ![Build process](img/2.png)

4. A green checkmark means a successful build. Your repo → **Releases** → Download the firmware package

5. If your device is already running Linux or OpenWrt, follow the steps below to upgrade.

   If your device has never been flashed with Linux or OpenWrt and is still on stock Android, follow the tutorial below. **Important: back up your partitions.**

   If the SIM card is not detected after flashing, try reinserting it several times. If it still isn't recognized, try the steps below. If you didn't back up the Android partitions, there's not much you can do — ask in the Discussions section and maybe someone kind will share a copy.
